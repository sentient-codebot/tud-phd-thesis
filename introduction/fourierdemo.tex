\strut\llap{\textcolor{newred}{\oldpilcrowsix}~}With the introduction of the printing press
from the late medieval period on, space before paragraphs was still left for
rubricators to add a pilcrow by hand. However in some circumstances, rubricators
could not draw fast enough for publishers' deadlines and books would often be
sold with the beginnings of the paragraphs left blank. This is how the practice
of indention before paragraphs was created.\autocite{Tschichold1992-ym}
